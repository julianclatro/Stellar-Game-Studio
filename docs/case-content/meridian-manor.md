## Clue Map

### Bedroom (Crime Scene)
- **Broken perfume bottle** — Smells odd, not like perfume. (Key evidence — it's the poison vial)
- **Smudged fingerprints on the door handle** — Multiple sets
- **A torn business letter** — Mentions a hostile takeover
- *Suspect:* Isabelle Fontaine (distraught, found the body)

### Kitchen
- **Wine glass with residue** — One glass wasn't properly washed
- **A missing chef's knife** — Elena insists she had a full set (red herring — the murder wasn't by knife)
- *Suspects:* Elena Castillo, Priya Sharma

### Study
- **Victor's briefcase** — Contains insurance documents with a large payout clause
- **A crumpled note** — "We need to talk about what you did. Tonight." (unsigned)
- *Suspects:* Victor Ashford, James Whitmore

### Lounge
- **Phone records on the table** — Dr. Webb's call log shows a 2-minute call, not the "hour-long" call he claims
- **An empty medicine bottle** — Prescribed to the victim, but emptied recently
- *Suspects:* Dr. Marcus Webb, Celeste Duval

### Garden
- **Muddy footprints** — Leading from the kitchen door to the bedroom window
- **A camera with photos** — Ren's photos include a timestamp showing the garden was empty at 8 PM (contradicts Thomas's alibi)
- *Suspects:* Thomas Grey, Ren Nakamura

## The Solution Path

How the player pieces it together:

1. Find the **broken perfume bottle** → smells chemical, not like perfume
2. Find **Victor's briefcase** with insurance payout documents → motive (financial gain)
3. Find the **crumpled note** → Victor knew something was happening tonight
4. Talk to **James Whitmore** with the insurance docs → James admits Victor was nervous all evening and stepped out for "fresh air"
5. Talk to **Isabelle** with the perfume bottle → she recognizes it as NOT the victim's perfume — "He never wore that scent"
6. Find **Dr. Webb's phone records** → his alibi collapses (only a 2-minute call)
7. Talk to **Dr. Webb** confronted with phone records → admits he saw Victor leaving the bedroom corridor but didn't think much of it
8. **Accusation:** Victor Ashford, with the poison vial, in the Bedroom

## Red Herrings & False Trails

- The **missing kitchen knife** suggests a stabbing — but the murder was by poison
- **Isabelle** being found near the body makes her look suspicious — but she genuinely discovered it
- **Thomas's** broken alibi (Ren's photos) makes him look like he's hiding something — but he was just sneaking a cigarette break, not murdering anyone
- The **muddy footprints** lead to the bedroom window but belong to Thomas (sneaking cigarettes), not the killer
- **Celeste** inherits from her brother and has motive — but she has a solid alibi with Dr. Webb (the 2 minutes they weren't together isn't enough)
