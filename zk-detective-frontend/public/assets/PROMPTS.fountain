# ACT ONE: THE REHEARSAL

= Phase 0 — Test the visual style across all 3 asset types before committing to 31 production generations. If the style doesn't land, tweak the Style Anchor on the title page and re-run only these 3 probes.

## THE THREE TESTS

= One probe per asset type: scene (room), portrait (suspect), icon (weapon). Each is identical to its Phase 1 counterpart plus a meta-instruction for style calibration.

INT. THE STUDY - NIGHT - STYLE PROBE #S1#

= Tests: environment rendering, ink linework weight, watercolor wash density, lighting/shadow interplay, color palette accuracy. Why the Study: richest visual elements (fireplace glow, bookshelves, scattered papers, whiskey decanter) — tests the most rendering challenges in one image.

A dark wood-paneled study in a Victorian manor. A heavy mahogany desk covered in scattered documents and an open briefcase. A whiskey decanter and glass sit on a side table. A crackling fireplace casts flickering orange light. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the walls. A crumpled note lies on the floor near the desk. Rich, heavy atmosphere with deep browns, amber, and gold. Viewed at an angle from the door. No text.

*This is a style reference test. Focus on establishing: ink linework weight, watercolor wash density, color palette accuracy (#0a0a0f, #14141f, #e8e6e3, #d4a843, #c8463b, #2a9d8f), and overall 1920s noir mood.*

VICTOR ASHFORD — STYLE PROBE #S2#
(Business Partner)

= Tests: face/body detail, dramatic side-lighting, transparent background handling, gold accent rendering. Why Victor: tailored suit + gold tie pin tests both fine detail and the warm accent color system.

Portrait of a middle-aged man in a sharp tailored suit with a silk tie. Clean-shaven, angular jawline, calculating dark eyes. Slicked-back hair. Confident but guarded expression — a man with secrets. Gold tie pin catches the light. Dramatic noir side-lighting. Bust/shoulder-up, 3/4 angle, looking slightly toward viewer. Ink linework with muted watercolor. Transparent background.

.STYLE TEST: POISON VIAL #S3#

= Tests: small-scale detail, object centering, crimson accent rendering, transparency. Why Poison Vial: glass, liquid, vapor, and label detail all at 200px — if this reads clearly, all icons will work.

A small glass vial with a cork stopper containing luminous green-purple liquid. A skull-and-crossbones label partially visible. Faint vapor wisps from the top. Crimson undertone accent. Centered on transparent background. 200x200px. Ink linework with watercolor.

> CHECKPOINT <

/* Review the 3 style probes above. If the style matches the noir detective aesthetic (correct ink weight, watercolor density, palette accuracy, and 1920s mood), proceed to Act Two. If adjustments are needed, tweak the Style Anchor on the title page and re-run the 3 probes before generating the full batch. */
